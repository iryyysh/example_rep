Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something in your teeth
Are there some aces up your sleeve

Have you no idea that you're in deep
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
Cause there's this tune I found
